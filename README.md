# Twitter Views Remover
This is a simple Chrome/Edge browser extension that removes the views of tweets from your Twitter feed. The extension works by selectively removing the DOM nodes that contain the views of the tweets, leaving only the tweet content visible.

## Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps:

- Download the latest release of the extension from the Releases tab of the repository.
- Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
- Open your Chrome/Edge browser and navigate to the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/ or edge://extensions/).
- Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner of the page.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you unzipped the extension files.
- The extension should now be installed and active. You can confirm this by checking the Extensions page, where you should see the "Twitter Views Remover" extension listed.

## Usage
Once the extension is installed and active, simply open Twitter and browse your feed as usual. The views of the tweets should be removed automatically as they are inserted into the DOM.

If you want to temporarily disable the extension, you can click the "Extensions" icon in the browser toolbar and toggle the switch next to "Twitter Views Remover". To permanently uninstall the extension, simply click the "Remove" button next to the extension in the Extensions page.
